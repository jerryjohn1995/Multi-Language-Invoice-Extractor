## Overview
Welcome to the Multi-Language Invoice Extractor Application repository! This project is designed to automate the extraction of data from various types of invoices, including handwritten and printed invoices, in multiple languages. Using Google Gemini as the primary Large Language Model (LLM) for data extraction and query handling, the application provides a seamless experience to upload invoices, extract critical information, and receive responses to user queries in real-time.

## Features
The Multi-Language Invoice Extractor is built to streamline the process of managing and analyzing invoice data. Key features include:

**1.Multi-format Invoice Support:**
- Extract data from handwritten or printed invoices in various languages.

**2.Intuitive User Interface Built with Streamlit:**

- Allows users to easily upload invoices.
- Displays uploaded invoices for visual confirmation.
- Provides a prompt input field for users to ask specific questions about the invoice.
  
**3. Deployed on Hugging Face:**
- The application is hosted on Hugging Face, making it accessible from anywhere and ensuring smooth and scalable deployments.

**4.Intelligent Query Handling:**
- Using Google Gemini as the LLM, users can ask complex, context-aware queries such as:

‚ÄúGive a summary about the invoice.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow only the item numbers.‚Äù

‚ÄúList the food items in the invoice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the total amount due?‚Äù

**5.Real-time Data Extraction and Responses:**
- The extracted information is processed and displayed immediately on the interface, making it easy for users to understand invoice details and get answers to their queries.

## Technologies Used

**1.Python**
Primary language for backend development and API integration.

**2.Google Gemini API**
Used for both data extraction from invoices and LLM-based query processing, providing a unified solution for reading and understanding invoice data.

**3.Streamlit**
Used for creating a responsive, user-friendly front-end interface. 

**4.Hugging Face**
Platform used for deploying the application, providing easy access and hosting.
